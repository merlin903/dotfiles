# Steven's dotfiles

This is my system's configuration. It is intended for my use, but might be of interest to other people to see
how I decide to configure things.

## TODO
- Finish configuring machine
  - Configure Git
  - Configure Emacs
  - Add homebrew script
  - Add cask script
- Add setup instructions
